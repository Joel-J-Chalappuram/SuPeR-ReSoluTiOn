# SuPeR-ReSoluTiOn
software that upscales low-resolution images while preserving and enhancing important visual details over their more standard counterpart, through generative adversarial network varieties, In particular, by using openCV, adversarial auto-encoder, boundary equilibrium generative adversarial networksÂ and clustering in generative adversarial networks
is an innovative project that combines the power of OpenCV and deep learning to revolutionize image super-resolution, addressing the increasing demand for higher-quality images in various domains, including medical imaging, surveillance, entertainment, and more.
